# ðŸŽ® What Am I?

**What Am I?** is a fast-paced, party-style web game designed for fun with friends or family! It's a guessing game where one person sees a secret word from a chosen category and difficulty, then gives cluesâ€”without saying the word itselfâ€”while others try to guess it. Perfect for game nights, parties, or classroom icebreakers.
